I had a dream we were sippin' whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery, nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines we stopped seein' eye to eye
You were stayin' out all night and I had enough

No, I don't wanna know where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home, and you'll be on your own
